# Types Of Variables

outlines how these work under the hood i guess...

## Boolean
Under the hood its basically just an int... with a value of either 1 or 0 (1 being true 0 being false)
for example if you wanted to set an int to 1 *technically* you can do this `int Example = true` as a boolean is just an int internally.

## Int
Used for storing a simple number ex. 11 or 21

## Float
Used for storing floating point values ex. 1.0f or 0.6f

## String
Used to store a string value, must ALWAYS be wrapped in `""`s

## Char
Used to store a single character value must be wrapped in `''`s
